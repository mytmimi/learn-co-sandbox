Hi! ðŸ‘‹

You've opened the IDE Sandbox. ðŸŽ‰

The Sandbox is an environment that you can access on "readme" and "code-along" lessons in Learn. It's a great place to experiment with code when you're not working on a "lab" (labs open the IDE In Browser).

The work you do in the Sandbox will be saved from lesson to lesson, and is automatically saved on your behalf to a repository in your GitHub account called `learn-co-sandbox`.

Please DO NOT touch this repository in GitHub, as it will affect your Sandbox experience, and potentially cause your work to be out of sync.

To learn more about the Sandbox, please visit http://help.learn.co/ide-in-browser#sandbox.
#Array Methods
#!!!important!!! arrays are indexed starting at 0
#read from the first = .first
#read from the last = .last
#read at some index = array[0] or array [3]
#change at index = array[index] = new value
#remove from end = array.pop
#remove from the front = array.shift
#remove from the middle = array.delete_at(index)
#add to front = array.unshift
#add to back = array.push, <<
#reverse = staff.reverse
#check if an item is in the array = array.include?
#insert at a particular spot without deleting what was there = array.insert(index, "")
